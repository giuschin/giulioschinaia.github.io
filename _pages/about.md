I recently defended my PhD (DPhil) at the [Department of Economics](https://www.economics.ox.ac.uk/) at the University of Oxford.

<!-- I am working for the [Development Innovation Lab](https://bfi.uchicago.edu/development-innovation-lab/) at the University of Chicago as a Postdoctoral Scholar. -->

My research interests are in development, labour, and behavioural economics. I use randomised and natural experiments to help answer policy questions.
My current research studies firm and household behaviour in low-income rural settings.

I am also affiliated with the [Applied Microeconomics research group](https://www.economics.ox.ac.uk/applied-microeconomics-0), the [Bissau Economics Lab](https://bissaueconomicslab.weebly.com/), the [Centre for the Study of African Economies](https://www.csae.ox.ac.uk/), and the [Mind and Behaviour Research Group](https://mbrg.bsg.ox.ac.uk/).

  <summary><b>Impact of Market Information on Cashew Producers in Guinea-Bissau</b><br>
  <i>with Brais Álvarez Pereira, Adewusi Mendonça, Dayvikson Raiss Laval Tavares, Sebastian Schäber</i>
</summary>
  <br>
  <p><i>Abstract:</i>  Does lack of information reduce the ability of producers to find the right time to sell their products? To answer this question, we ran a two-level cluster randomised controlled experiment among cashew producers in 290 villages in Guinea-Bissau. Treated producers received weekly messages to their mobiles during the trading season in 2020. The messages provided up-to-date market news, farmgate prices, and gave sales advice. Treated producers earned more from their transactions and sold their cashews more frequently relative to other producers, who tend to sell their cashews in a single transaction. We find evidence that between-village spillovers may lead us to underestimate treatment effects on average prices within treated villages. We found no evidence suggesting that treated producers changed their buyers, the location of their sales, had better record keeping, or different attitudes towards risk. Given the low cost of our intervention, market information can be a cost-effective tool to increase producers’ incomes. </p>

  <summary><b>Labour Market Effects of Ethiopia's Social Safety Net</b></summary>
    <br>
  <p><i>Abstract:</i>  This  paper assesses how a large transfer programme combining public works and unconditional transfers to food-insecure households in rural Ethiopia affects local labour markets. Using  repeated cross-sections of the National Labour Force Survey, I show that the programme did not change employment rates or wages in this rural economy. Instead, I find that workers shifted from agricultural to non-agricultural self-employment. I complement this analysis using  data from the Ethiopian Socio-Economic surveys and find similar results.  These results are at odds with previous work due to the thinness of rural wage markets in Ethiopia.</p>

  <summary><b>The Future in Mind: Aspirations and Long-term Outcomes in Rural Ethiopia</b><br>
  <i>with Tanguy Bernard, Stefan Dercon, Kate Orkin, Alemayehu Seyoum Taffesse</i></summary>
    <br>
  <p><i>Abstract:</i>  Aspirations have been posited to condition the future-oriented choices of individuals and thus can play a role in the persistence of poverty or the effort to break out of it. In a randomised control trial in remote, rural Ethiopia, we assess the effectiveness of an intervention seeking to change how poor people perceive their future opportunities, alter their aspirations and, through that, modify their investment decisions. A treatment group was shown video documentaries about the lives of individuals from similar communities who escaped poverty through their own efforts and, as such, can serve as role models. Five years after the screening took place, the treated households increased future-oriented investments in agriculture and in children's education. The results can be explained by the increase in aspirations in terms of lifetime goals. Overall, this research uniquely provides evidence that a light-touch behavioural intervention can have persistent economic impacts on a poor population.</p>
